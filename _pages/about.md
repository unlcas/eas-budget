The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is proposing to close the Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences (EAS) as part of its <a href="https://budgetprocess.unl.edu/proposed-budget-reductions/">budget reduction plan</a>. *We strongly oppose this plan*. EAS conducts research and workforce training that is critical to the interests of Nebraska. The university has failed to consider departmental strengths such as students’ post-graduation success and alumni support, and the uniqueness of the EAS Geology and Meteorology programs.  

Cutting EAS would mean cutting research and education on <a href="https://nebraska.edu/strategic-plan">NU Presidential priorities</a>, including critical minerals and energy resources (uranium, petroleum, natural gas, and natural/geologic hydrogen). It would mean cutting research and education on topics vital to everyday Nebraskans, such as severe storms. It would mean that no graduate from the NU flagship campus would be equipped to take the Professional Geologist licensing exam, and no one educated in Nebraska could become a federal meteorologist, period. These doors would close even if some EAS faculty were retained in other departments. *Closure of EAS removes pathways for student success. It is bad for UNL, bad for the NU system, and bad for the State of Nebraska.*

## EAS Statement

"The proposed cuts to our undergraduate and graduate programs would represent a severe loss for the University and the citizens of our state. For a state such as Nebraska, with an economy strongly tied to the land and the climate and where natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, and ice storms are frequent hazards, it should be inconceivable that these educational programs have been proposed for elimination."

Dr. Clinton Rowe, EAS Department Chair

## FAQ

<details><summary>What is the university proposing?</summary>
UNL is proposing to eliminate the Geology and Meteorology majors from undergrad to PhD level, and fire staff and faculty in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, including tenured faculty. The university says that it will retain “High-performing faculty… within other UNL units to preserve educational pathways and research expertise.” The department has about 17 FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) and UNL is proposing to fire 12.
</details>\

<details><summary>I’m a current student. What does this proposal mean for me?</summary>
Right now, keep doing what you’re doing. Executive Vice Chancellor Mark Button has stated that the university cares about student success, and has assured the department that students who have begun their program will be able to finish it. When asked for details, Dr. Button was unable to provide a plan. However, a commitment to student success is what has kept most EAS faculty members in academia, rather than in the more lucrative private industry jobs that we train our students for. Whatever happens, the faculty has your back. Please feel free to schedule a time with any professor in the department to talk about your individual options.
</details>\

<details><summary>What is an FTE?</summary>
FTE stands for Full Time Equivalent. It’s a way to measure the number of people working for a department. Faculty with a joint appointment will have some proportion of FTE in more than one department. A reduction in FTE means firing people.
</details>\

<details><summary>Why was EAS recommended for elimination?</summary>
The recommendation was driven by a university ranking process that relied on limited and, in some cases, problematic data. This analysis placed EAS roughly 20th the bottom, but those results do not reflect the department’s actual strengths. EAS enrolls nearly 90 undergraduates, welcomed 27 new majors this fall, and supports more than 30 graduate students. Our graduates are highly successful in careers across industry, government, and education. Another factor in the recommendation was the assumption that students could receive equivalent training through the Institute for Agriculture and Natural Resources (IANR). In fact, the courses available in IANR—even with select faculty moving—do not meet the requirements for certification in meteorology or eligibility for the professional geologist licensing exam. These professional pathways remain unique to EAS.
</details>

<details><summary>Why shouldn’t EAS be eliminated?</summary>
EAS contains two programs that are unique in Nebraska: geology and meteorology. Our faculty embody the “Odyssey to the Extraordinary,” with NSF Career Grant awardees, Fulbright fellows, and even a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Experiential learning is built into our curriculum, with upcoming field trips planned to the Four Corners region and to Iceland. Our faculty work on Nebraska problems, like tornadoes and uranium contamination, and opportunities like emerging critical minerals. Staff don’t tend to get as much credit, but the EAS staff deserve credit for keeping the place going. Our students and alumni embody Husker excellence, with very high job placement post-graduation. Also, not to be overlooked – unlike many departments, we all like each other. EAS is stronger together, and we make “The Good Life” better.  
</details>

<details><summary>How is EAS different from offerings in the Institute for Agriculture and Natural Resources (IANR)?</summary>
EAS contains the only meteorology program in the state of Nebraska, and the only graduate-level geology program in the state of Nebraska. Undergraduate alumni can get a job as a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, or become a Professional Geologist. EAS has a broader range of earth science subdisciplines than researchers in IANR, such as structural geology and severe weather. This enables EAS to conduct research important to the State, but which wouldn’t fit in with IANR, such as tornado forecasting and research in critical minerals and energy resources. A handful of faculty pulled from EAS would not be able to achieve the success of the department as a whole. 
</details>

<details><summary>How would EAS elimination affect the structural deficit?</summary>
UNL is treating faculty and staff as a cost, as if the university were employing people out of pure charity. The fact is, UNL needs faculty and staff to generate tuition and grant money, and to keep everything running smoothly. By eliminating a unique program in the state of Nebraska, this proposal would ultimately make the structural deficit worse in years to come, due to student attrition and fewer grants. If faculty were 100% cost to the institution with no benefit, they would never be hired in the first place. And if staff weren’t vital to the operation of the university, the upper administration would be reducing their own staff rather than pulling staff away from departments like EAS to support the administration instead.  
</details>

<details><summary>Does EAS do anything for the community?</summary>
Yes! The department’s biggest outreach event is Dinosaurs & Disasters, which is held at the Morrill Hall Museum every February. We also recently started a Public Understanding of Science lecture series in honor of our former chair, Norm Smith. Individual faculty do everything from organizing summer camps to identifying rocks from photos sent to the department. EAS also supports K–12 education by teaching the geoscience courses needed for teacher certification with an endorsement in Earth and Space Science, as well as a long-standing summer field course for educators. Through this work, our impact reaches classrooms across Nebraska.
</details>

<details><summary>Will this affect tenured faculty?</summary>
Yes! According to UNL bylaws, tenured faculty can be fired (with a year’s notice) as a result of program elimination. However, UNL is also proposing “to preserve educational pathways and research expertise,” which suggests that the program is being restructured rather than eliminated, going against the spirit of the bylaws. More importantly, this proposal would also affect untenured and non-tenure-track faculty and staff, as well as students. 
</details>

<details><summary>What is the university’s plan for alumni donations?</summary>
The university has not shared any specific plans with EAS. Our alumni have been very generous in supporting students through scholarships and awards, including funding that helps cover the cost of the geology majors’ capstone field camp and other field experiences. At this point, it is not clear how these funds would be managed in the future.
</details>

<details><summary>If not EAS, what should the university cut?</summary>
EAS stands against cutting any university teaching programs. There are other options. Some options may be painful, like reduction in retirement benefits or administrator salaries, but there are options that do not damage UNL’s standing or reduce our ability to give students a world-class education.
