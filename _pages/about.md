The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is proposing to close the Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences (EAS) as part of its <a href="https://budgetprocess.unl.edu/proposed-budget-reductions/">budget reduction plan</a>. *We strongly oppose this plan*. EAS conducts research and workforce training that is critical to the interests of Nebraska. The university has failed to consider departmental strengths such as students’ post-graduation success and alumni support, and the uniqueness of the EAS Geology and Meteorology programs.  

Cutting EAS would mean cutting research and education on <a href="https://nebraska.edu/strategic-plan">NU Presidential priorities</a>, including critical minerals and energy resources (uranium, petroleum, natural gas, and natural/geologic hydrogen). It would mean cutting research and education on topics vital to everyday Nebraskans, such as severe storms. It would mean that no graduate from the NU flagship campus would be equipped to take the Professional Geologist licensing exam, and no one educated in Nebraska could become a federal meteorologist, period. These doors would close even if some EAS faculty were retained in other departments. *Closure of EAS removes pathways for student success. It is bad for UNL, bad for the NU system, and bad for the State of Nebraska.*

## EAS Statement

"The proposed cuts to our undergraduate and graduate programs would represent a severe loss for the University and the citizens of our state. For a state such as Nebraska, with an economy strongly tied to the land and the climate and where natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, and ice storms are frequent hazards, it should be inconceivable that these educational programs have been proposed for elimination."

Dr. Clinton Rowe, EAS Department Chair

## FAQ

<details><summary>What is the university proposing?</summary>
UNL is proposing to eliminate the Geology and Meteorology majors from undergrad to PhD level, and fire staff and faculty in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, including tenured faculty. The university says that it will retain “High-performing faculty… within other UNL units to preserve educational pathways and research expertise.” The department has about 17 FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) and UNL is proposing to fire 12.
</details>
<details><summary>I’m a current student. What does this proposal mean for me?</summary>
Right now, keep doing what you’re doing. Executive Vice Chancellor Mark Button has stated that the university cares about student success, and has assured the department that students who have begun their program will be able to finish it. When asked for details, Dr. Button was unable to provide a plan. However, a commitment to student success is what has kept most EAS faculty members in academia, rather than in the more lucrative private industry jobs that we train our students for. Whatever happens, the faculty has your back. Please feel free to schedule a time with any professor in the department to talk about your individual options.
