Thank you to those who have supported EAS thus far, with letters, comments to the APC and testimony!  If you are new to this story, please see our [previous post]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/2025/10/proposed-for-elimination/). You can find the full text of the narrative that we gave to the APC [here]({{site.baseurl}}/files/EAS_Response_to_APC.pdf) and the video of the hearing on October 10, 2025, [here](https://mediahub.unl.edu/media/25758). We noted that the justification read into the record was not the one we had been given in September and our response to the APC is [here]({{site.baseurl}}/files/APC_additional_information.pdf).

On October 31, 2025, the APC recommendations were made public. The full text of this report is available [here](https://budgetprocess.unl.edu/sites/unl.edu.budget-process/files/media/file/20251024_apc_recommendation.pdf).  Note that the APC recommendation was against elimination of EAS. Community and alumni letters and emails to the APC were an important part of their decision to support EAS in the face of the Chancellor’s original proposal. EAS was working on [a response]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Response_to_APC_vote.pdf) to the APC report when the Chancellor's recommendations were made public.

On November 10, 2025, Chancellor Rodney Bennett submitted to the NU President and Board of Regents his [final proposal](https://budgetprocess.unl.edu/final-budget-reduction-plan) that includes elimination of the Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences. Now, we turn our efforts toward convincing President Gold and the Board of Regents that elimination of our department and its academic and research programs will hurt the interests of the University, the State, and the people of Nebraska. 

# The Board of Regents’ Meeting on 12/5/25 

The Board of Regents will consider the Chancellor’s proposal at their [next meeting](https://nebraska.edu/news-and-events/events/2025/12/board-of-regents-meeting-december-5), the agenda for which will be linked here when available. There is always a place on the agenda for public comments. Please consider attending this meeting and voicing your opinion on the proposed cuts. We have a limited number of our “Save EAS” T-shirts available on a first-come, first-served basis either before the day of the meeting from the EAS office (126 Bessey Hall) or at Varner Hall on the day of the meeting. 

To speak at the Regents Meeting, if the topic is on the agenda for the meeting, you can simply show up and speak. However, you can also E-mail the Corporation Secretary for the Board of Regents, [Katie Hoffman](mailto:katiehoffman@nebraska.edu), at least 24 hours in advance to request a time to speak (traditionally 3 minutes). Include your name, address, phone number, and the topic you will address. You can also include a copy of your comments - if you do so, they will be included in the record of the meeting.
