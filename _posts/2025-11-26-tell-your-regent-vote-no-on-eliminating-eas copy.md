You may have seen the EAS [video]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Why_NE_Needs_EAS.mp4) that aired during the Iowa game! It is more important than ever that your Regent hears from YOU as well as us. There are two ways to make your feelings and thoughts known to the Regents as below. If you are new to this story, check out our [previous post]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/2025/11/tell-your-regent-vote-no-on-elminating-eas).
1. **Write to your Regent!** The map of Regent districts is [here](https://nebraskalegislature.gov/about/regents_map.php). You can find information on each Regent [here](https://nebraska.edu/regents/board-members/) and their direct email addresses.
2. **Show up at the public comment section!** You must be there before the meeting starts to sign in (and/or have registered your intent to speak with the Corporation Secretary for the Board of Regents, [Katie Hoffman](mailto:katiehoffman@nebraska.edu), at least 24 hours in advance). Include your name, address, phone number, and the topic you will address.
