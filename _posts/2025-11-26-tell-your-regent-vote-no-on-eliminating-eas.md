We are fast approaching the Board of Regents’ meeting on Dec 5, 9am in Varner Hall (3835 Holdrege Street, Lincoln, NE). The agenda will be released [here](https://nebraska.edu/regents/agendas-minutes/) and there is a public comment section.  There are two ways to make your feelings and thoughts known to the Regents as below. If you are new to this story, check out our [previous post]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/2025/11/the-hearing-recommendations-and-responses/).
1. **Write to your Regent!** The map of Regent districts is [here](https://nebraskalegislature.gov/about/regents_map.php). You can find information on each Regent [here](https://nebraska.edu/regents/board-members/) and their direct email addresses.
2. **Show up at the public comment section!** You must be there before the meeting starts to sign in (and/or have registered your intent to speak with the Corporation Secretary for the Board of Regents, [Katie Hoffman](mailto:katiehoffman@nebraska.edu), at least 24 hours in advance). Include your name, address, phone number, and the topic you will address.
